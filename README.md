# ClipKart - YouTube Shorts Creator

ClipKart is a Python web application that automatically downloads YouTube videos, identifies the most interesting scenes, and creates vertical short-form videos (1080x1920) with captions. The output videos are optimized for platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts and limited to 60 seconds.
